(I am not principled about my pronouns and in Russian I mostly write about myself in the masculine gender if I communicate with good acquaintances)

./づ~ 🍓" 𝙢𝙞𝙣𝙤𝙧 (14 y.o) I have a stable psyche (I can't guarantee a healthy and neurodiverse one, but I'm not sure since I have no diagnoses other than my own), so don't worry if you are much older than me. If you are under 9 years old, communicate with me at your own risk.  

✧ I feel a little uncomfortable calling myself by my real name, so only close friends can call me by my real name.  

✧ My nicknames that I usually use on different social media outlets: pancake, damilord, glazedcurd (You can call me whatever you want, or by my character's name in PT!)

✧ I 𝓶𝓲𝓰𝓱𝓽  be sensitive, but I don't take offense at joking insults. And I won't just respond with moralizing, insults and the like. So I don't care what your fetishes are or what kind of person you are (I'm no angel myself, however if you have triggers or DNI factors warn me right away. I won't bring up unpleasant topics on purpose)
